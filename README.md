Slow down a Matroska-contained movie to correct for PAL speedup.

In regions that historically used the
[PAL television standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL), films shot at 24
frames per second (fps) were converted for television (including VHS and DVD)
at 25 fps, resulting in a 4% speedup with audio pitched up by nearly a
semitone. This problem generally does not affect newer digital formats (e.g.
Blu-ray), except in rare cases where a "new" release is created by upscaling an
older transfer that already exhibits speedup. (Looking at you, Doctor Who TV
movie!) Learn more about PAL speedup
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576i#PAL_speed-up).

This script forces a framerate change to the video track(s), avoiding
re-encoding and leaving the underlying data alone. Audio tracks are slowed to
match and re-sampled at their original sample rates, fixing the pitch issue and
ensuring audio and video remain in sync. Subtitles and chapters are re-timed to
match.

I prefer this solution to re-encoding the entire video, as the latter adds the
possibility of quality loss. The resulting framerate will almost always be
nonstandard, but capable video players (e.g. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html))
have no issue with this -- and there is no excuse in this day and age for video
players not to support arbitrary framerates. (Resampling audio is unfortunately
unavoidable, since many audio formats only support a small set of sample rates.)

Portions of this script were adapted from code posted by James Ainslie
